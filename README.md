# Smart City Management System - Java OOP Learning Project

A comprehensive, modular Java project designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through a practical Smart City Management System. Each module progressively introduces new OOP concepts while remaining independently executable.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project consists of **5 progressive modules**, each building upon the previous one to demonstrate fundamental to advanced Java OOP concepts. Students learn by building a complete Smart City Management System that manages buildings (hospitals, schools, offices, parks) with increasing sophistication.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing all modules, students will master:
- **Module 1**: Classes, Objects, Methods, Data Types, Conditionals, Loops, I/O
- **Module 2**: Encapsulation, Access Modifiers, Getters/Setters, Static Members, Method Overloading
- **Module 3**: Inheritance, Constructors, Super Keyword, Method Overriding
- **Module 4**: Final Keyword, Enums, Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Casting
- **Module 5**: Exception Handling, Custom Exceptions, ArrayList, Iterator, Enhanced For Loop
